# Getting started with Horizon

First, install horizon from npm:

```
$ npm install -g horizon
```

Now you can initialize a new horizon project:

```
$ hz init example-app
```

This will create a directory with the following files:

```
$ tree -aF example-app/
example-app/
├── dist/
│   └── index.html
├── .hzconfig
└── src/
```

The `dist` directory is where you should output your static
files. Horizon doesn't have any opinions about what front-end build
system you use, just that the files to serve end up in `dist`. Your
source files would go into `src` but that's just a convention. Horizon
doesn't touch anything in `src`.

If you want, you can `npm init` or `bower init` in the `example-app`
directory to set up dependencies etc.

By default, horizon creates a basic `index.html` to serve so you can
verify everything is working:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <script src="/horizon/horizon.js"></script>
    <script>
      var horizon = Horizon();
      horizon.onConnected(function() {
        document.querySelector('h1').innerHTML = 'It works!'
      });
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
   <marquee><h1></h1></marquee>
  </body>
</html>
```

Finally, let's start up a Horizon server in dev mode. This will start
a RethinkDB instance, connect to it, and serve our static files from
`example-app/dist`.

```
$ hz serve example-app --dev
warn: Creating insecure HTTP server.
info: Serving static files from dist
info: Listening on 127.0.0.1:8181.
...
info: Metadata synced with server, ready for queries.
```

## Setting up your Horizon Dev Environment

If you are looking to work on Horizon itself, you will want your recent
changes to update your command line client `hz` without having to go back
into each `/client`, `/server`, and `/cli` directory to reinstall. So you
will want to use `npm link` to update this on the fly.

We've included a script at `/test/setupDev.sh` that you can run while
currently in the `/test` directory that will set your `hz` up in your
global npm folder.

Or you can follow these commands which achieve the same result:

```bash
# From the /client directory
npm link

# From the /server directory
npm link ../client
npm link

# From the /cli directory
npm link ../server
npm link ../client
npm link
```

## Horizon CLI `hz` || `horizon`

### `hz init`
Create a horizon app directory, automatically creating a `src` and `dist`
directory within the folder.

Positional Args | Description
----------------|------------
projectName |  Name of directory to create. Defaults to current directory

### `hz serve`

This serves the directory and supplies all the tooling needed for serving a
Horizon web application.

##### Available options

Positional Args | Description
----------------|------------
project | Change to this directory before serving

Optional Args| Description
------------|----------------------------------
  --bind HOST         | Local hostname to serve Horizon on (repeatable).
  --port PORT         | Local port to serve horizon on. Defaults to `8181`.
  --connect HOST:PORT | Host and port of the RethinkDB server to connect to. Defaults to localhost:28015
  --key-file PATH     | Path to the key file to use, defaults to `./key.pem`.
  --cert-file PATH    | Path to the cert file to use, defaults to `./cert.pem`.
  --allow-unauthenticated | Whether to allow unauthenticated Horizon connections.
  --debug             | Enable debug logging.
  --insecure          | Serve insecure websockets, ignore `--key-file` and `--cert-file`.
  --start-rethinkdb   | Start up a RethinkDB server in the current directory
  --auto-create-table | Create tables used by requests if they do not exist
  --auto-create-index | Create indexes used by requests if they do not exist
  --serve-static [PATH] | Serve static files from a directory. Defaults to `dist`.
  --dev               | Runs the server in development mode, this sets `--debug`, `--insecure`, `--auto-create-tables`, and `--auto-create-indexes`.

  #### Serving securely, generating certs for SSL
  There are proper ways to get a certificate registered through a Certificate
  Authority, but for the purpose of getting up-and-running as soon as possible,
  generate a self-signed certificate.  This command will generate the certificate
  using the default options from `openssl`, and should not be used for anything
  serious:

  ```sh
  openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout horizon-key.pem -out horizon-cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -batch
  ```

  Once a key file and cert file have been obtained, launch the server without the `--insecure`
  flag, and provide the files in the `--key-file` and `--cert-file` options.
