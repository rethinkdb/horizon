<center>![](https://i.imgur.com/XFostB8.gif)</center>

## Running this example
1) Install Horizon: "npm install -g horizon"
2) Install RethinkDB: https://rethinkdb.com/docs/install/
3) Run "horizon serve --dev" in this directory
4) Open http://127.0.0.1:8181

## Ideas for future

- [ ] implement `presence`
- [ ] implement `geo` to display users differently that are geographically near you
- [ ] implement `auth` to allow users to log in via Github, Twitter, etc and have their handle appear.
