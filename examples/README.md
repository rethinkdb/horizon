# Horizon Extension Examples

We decided it was important to leverage Horizon alongside all your normal app functions. Here are some basic examples of how one would extend your JS web framework of choice with Horizon:  [express](https://github.com/strongloop/express), [koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa), or [hapi](https://github.com/hapijs) frameworks with Horizon.

* [Horizon & Koa](/examples/koa-server)
* [Horizon & Hapi](/examples/hapi-server)

# Horizon App Examples
And finally, we've created a few example applications to help you get started with Horizon. In each directory
you will find a `dist` folder which will have all the files needed to serve the example application. In some of the
TodoMVC examples, you will find a `package.json` inside the `dist` directory, and you will need to run `npm install` for
some of their dependencies.
